# Knapsack-packing-Muzzy-
Knapsack algorithm

Muzzy likes clocks. Clocks that show more time (in range 00:00 - 11:59) are tastier for Muzzy, and taste grows linearly to time. Today Muzzy rushed into clock shop, he wants to fill his knapsack with clocks. But he has only few pounds and pence (Muzzy is from UK). Help Muzzy to estimate, how many minutes he can buy in best case, if you know what time clocks show (up to minutes), their price (up to pence) and Muzzy's budget. First line of input.txt stores repeating pairs time1 cost1 time2 cost2...timeN costN. Second line stores Muzzy's budget in pounds.

output.txt should contain the only number: maximum number of minutes (int) Muzzy can earn.
